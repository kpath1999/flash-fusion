# Docs

Living notes to align the paper narrative with the code. Suggested files:
- intent-schema.md: defines the constrained intent set and scoring rules.
- prompt-catalog.md: documents available prompt templates and required inputs.
- fallback-behavior.md: decision tree for out-of-scope handling (reject, raw data, RAG).

Keep these in sync with configs under src/config/.
